      <h1>Cheese Omelette</h1>
      <img src="images/cheeseomelette.webp">
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This cheese omelette is great for breakfast. My family and friends love omelettes and nothing makes them happier. When cooking an omelette, it's important that you keep the temperature on the low side, as you don't want it to turn brown.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3, 6 or 12 large eggs</li>
        <li>At least 1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2, 4 or 8 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4, 1/2 or 1 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
      </ol>
